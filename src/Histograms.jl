```julia
histcounts(x, xedges::AbstractRange; T=Int64)::Vector{T}
```
A 1D histogram, ignoring NaNs: calculate the number of `x` values that fall into
each of `length(xedges)-1` equally spaced bins along the `x` axis with bin edges
specified by `xedges`.

By default, the counts are returned as `Int64`s, though this can be changed by
specifying an output type with the optional keyword argument `T`.

## Examples
```julia
julia> b = 10 * rand(100000);

julia> histcounts(b, 0:1:10)
10-element Vector{Int64}:
 10054

```julia
histcounts(x, y, xedges::AbstractRange, yedges::AbstractRange; T=Int64)::Matrix{T}
```
A 2D histogram, ignoring NaNs: calculate the number of `x, y` pairs that fall into
each square of a 2D grid of equally-spaced square bins with edges specified by
`xedges` and `yedges`.

The resulting matrix `N` of counts is oriented with the lowest x and y bins in
`N[1,1]`, where the first (vertical / row) dimension of `N` corresponds to the y
axis (with `size(N,1) == length(yedges)-1`) and the second (horizontal / column)
dimension of `N` corresponds to the x axis (with `size(N,2) == length(xedges)-1`).

By default, the counts are returned as `Int64`s, though this can be changed by
specifying an output type with the optional keyword argument `T`.

## Examples
```julia
julia> x = y = 0.5:9.5;

julia> xedges = yedges = 0:10;

julia> N = histcounts(x,y,xedges,yedges)
